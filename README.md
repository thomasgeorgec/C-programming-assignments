effective encoding
there is an encoding in which each alphabet is followed by the frequency of that particular 
alphabet in the string.
but there is a small problem with existing solution, that is there might be multiple entries for 
same alphabet
write a function to take the string as argument and return the string without duplication
eg:
input a12b14c23d1b2
output a12b16c23d1
